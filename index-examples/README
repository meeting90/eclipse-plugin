The separate compilation examples are a set of language examples to validate 
and test out approaches of the semantic index libraries.

IMPORTANT: To compile these examples both spoofax and spoofax-contrib need 
to be checked out in the same directory because the index libraries from the 
org.spoofax.interpreter.library.language project are used. The directory 
structure should look as follows with root directory SVN:
- SVN/spoofax/trunk/spoofax/org.spoofax.interpreter.library.language/...
- SVN/spoofax-contrib/separate-compilation-examples/...

The Spoofax nightly version (http://www.lclnet.nl/update/nightly) is required 
as well!


If you get an "module lib/analysis-auto.generated not found" error while
building, open the main SDF file from the project, edit and save it.
